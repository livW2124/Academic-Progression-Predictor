# Academic-Progression-Predictor
A Program to Forecast Student Outcomes at the University


The program is a Python-based solution that enables university students to predict their progression outcomes, and staff members to do the same for multiple students. It includes validation features and a histogram feature. It has two extensions, namely a vertical histogram and the ability to store input progression data in various formats, including a text file.

## Validation ✅

Displays 'Integer required' if a credit input is the wrong data type
Displays 'Out of range' if credits entered are not in the range 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120
Displays 'Total incorrect' if the total of the pass, defer, and fail credits is not 120


## Running the Program ⚙️
